# WorkAround-Explorer
A web application used to view salary trend data.

WorkAround is a fictional research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry.

-What's included?
+ mock role, company and salary data
+ Functions for filtering salary data to get subsets of data by role and by company.
+ A utility module with a function that formats the salary to standard format with commas

-Purpose
This web app allows users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:
+ The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
+ The industry average for the chosen role.
+ The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
+ The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

-Results
After completing this simulation, I am that much more capable of explaining and teaching others about modules, as well as, ES6 imports and exports for frontend/browser runtime built using JavaScript.
